# Bluetooth
A project I created for my university, it`s an android app whitch is capable of connecting/pairing to any device
turning bluetooth on/off and making the device visible.

Its purpose is to communicate with the HC-05 module that is connected to an arduino device via the app you can
set an alarm threshold, check current alarm threshold and check current temperature. If the current temperature
read from the DHT11 sensor is bigger than the alarm threshold the module lights up a LED

The arduino code was written by my lecturer Artur Dylong, it was designed to work with a different 
temperature sensor so I reworked it to work with DHT11 and translated the comments to English

The android app was writen solely by me
